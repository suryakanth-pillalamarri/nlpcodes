"In today's fast-paced world, artificial intelligence (AI) and natural language processing (NLP) play crucial roles. NLP enables machines to understand human language, process text, and communicate effectively. Sentiment analysis algorithms gauge public opinion on social media platforms, helping brands understand customer feedback. Named entity recognition (NER) identifies entities like names (John Doe, Alice), dates (January 1st, 2023), and locations (New York, Paris) in text, crucial for information extraction. Machine translation allows instant communication across languages (e.g., English, Español, 中文), facilitating global interactions. Text summarization condenses lengthy documents into concise summaries, aiding in content digestion. Information retrieval systems index and retrieve relevant documents based on user queries, enhancing search efficiency. Preprocessing involves tokenization, splitting text into meaningful units; stopwords removal; stemming to reduce words to their root form; and vectorization, converting text into numerical representations for machine learning models.
